Implementing Foster's inverse for optimizing the components extraction during SSS reconstruction of MEG data. 
Compare this implementation to the iterative SSS method "xi.mat" and the traditional SSS method
Main code current uses covariance "covariance.mat" file from MNE-Python SQUID sensors on a simulated current dipole. 
Need to investigate different noise covarience matrices "N"
